# EPC: My Production Workflow

This is how I code. Fast, efficient, production-ready. No fluff.

> **My philosophy: Ship code that works.**  
> - Every decision ships to production
> - Performance beats perfection
> - Working code now > elegant code later
> - Measure everything, guess nothing

## Why I Built This

Standard AI assistants waste my time with essays. I need:
- Instant fixes for real problems
- Responses under 300 tokens
- Code that goes straight to production
- Zero explanations unless I ask

## Commands

```bash
/epc optimize search          # Standard: analyze → plan → fix
/epc quick fix memory leak    # Quick: instant pattern match
/epc emergency payment crash  # Emergency: fix now, think later
/epc typescript add types     # TypeScript mode
/epc analyze slow checkout    # Deep dive (when needed)
```

## My Agents

**🟡 javascript-specialist** - Algorithms & performance. O(n²)→O(n). Done.

**🔵 react-virtuoso** - React UI. <16ms renders. Accessible. Fast.

**⚪ git-wizard** - Git operations. Clean history. No merge hell.

## Instant Fixes

| Problem | Solution | Confidence |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Slow list | React.memo | 10/10 |
| undefined error | Optional chaining | 10/10 |
| Memory leak | WeakMap | 9/10 |
| Prop drilling | Context | 9/10 |
| Stack overflow | Remove recursion | 10/10 |

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **Code goes to files** - Never in chat
2. **Metrics only** - 500ms→50ms, not "faster"
3. **One solution** - The right one
4. **Ship confidence** - Every fix has a score
5. **Production first** - Works > perfect

## My Standards

**Performance:**
- Renders <16ms or it's broken
- Bundle <250KB or it's bloated
- O(n²) is unacceptable
- Memory leaks = emergency

**Quality:**
- Functions <50 lines
- Complexity <10
- Accessibility required
- Tests when critical

## What I Don't Do

❌ Explain obvious things  
❌ Show multiple options  
❌ Justify simple fixes  
❌ Write documentation first  
❌ Optimize prematurely  
❌ Debate patterns  

## Results

My workflow ships code that:
- Handles millions of users
- Renders in milliseconds
- Recovers from errors
- Scales without rewrites

This isn't about following trends. It's about shipping code that works, performs, and scales. Today.
